This was a group project for ISM6225 Distributed Information Systems at USF. Group members: James Long, Michael Borkland, Aston Wright. The project began with selection of a public data set accessible via API, data model design, site layout design, and UI design. This was followed by controller and view development, API integration, and data model implementation. Visual Studio, C#, GitHub, Azure Portal, and Azure SQL Database were the primary tools.

James made a short video of the live application at the request of the university. The video is now posted on USF's MS-BAIS webpage.
